# Anchored Hybrid Enrichment Tools
This is a set of tools and tutorials designed for handling Anchored Hybrid Enrichment data. It incorporates:  
+ filtering protocols from EAPhy (https://github.com/MozesBlom/EAPhy)  
+ phylogenetic estimation using ASTRAL (https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL) and starBEAST2 (https://www.beast2.org/)  
+ and assorted bits of code for data handling  
It's not exhaustive, and it's brief, but it's someplace to start.
